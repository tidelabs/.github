# TIDE-LABS FOUNDATION

Tide Labs Foundation is a non-profit foundation based in Zug, Switzerland. Tide Labs was founded to solve the most important challenge of Web 3: Creating an inclusive and easily accessible financial infrastructure that truly works for everyone.

Today, decentralized finance is both a promising leap for democratization of finance while arguably also one of its largest failures. We are convinced that decentralized technologies and blockchains have all the right ingredients to improve livelihoods for the many, foster human connections and redefine the things we collectively value and work towards. However, the reality today is much more sobering:

To date, Web3 undoubtedly has opened many doors for many people. At the same time, it fails to protect or often even consider the most vulnerable groups of people that need its innovation the most. This tale is told through countless hacks, pyramid schemes, rugpulls, collusion and projects that are based on the premise of enriching the few, rather than empowering the many.

We want to be an antidote to these stories and be among the forces of light in the crypto industry based on transparency, trust and a level playing field. To this end, we support, fund and create open source technologies and make sure they can be accessed and securely used by as many people as possible.

##Â What we do

- **Research and Development**: Tide Labs researches and builds cutting edge technologies based-on or complementing open sources Distributed Ledger Technologies. From security to user-experience, Tide Labs aims to contribute to a responsible and accessible decentralized web.
- **Ecosystem Building**: At the core of our ecosystem sits Tidechain, a substrate-based Blockchain optimized for scalability of digital-asset transactions and security of its users. To this end, we bring together and support the brightest minds in the industry and support them through our community-governed grants program and extensive community treasury.
- **Grants**: The community treasury of Tidefi Tokens totaled 40% of all Tidefi tokens that were minted at Genesis. These tokens are all subject to full community governance.
- **Toward the TIDEFI DAO**: Tidelabs actively supports efforts to create a DAO funded by the Tidechain Community Treasury. While the community treasury itself holds all the keys to this endeavor, we want to invite you to collaboratively build a value-driven autonomous organization taking progressively more control over the Tidechain ecosystem.
